# Hybrid Trading RSI Divergence MT4

This is a code for a MetaTrader 4 (MT4) Expert Advisor (EA) called Hybrid Trading RSI Divergence. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is designed to trade forex markets based on RSI (Relative Strength Index) divergences.

## Product Description

The Hybrid Trading RSI Divergence MT4 EA is a powerful tool that helps traders identify potential trading opportunities by detecting RSI divergences. RSI is a widely used technical indicator that measures the strength and weakness of a market. Divergence occurs when the price and the RSI indicator move in opposite directions, suggesting a potential reversal or continuation of the trend.

This EA is designed to automatically open positions based on the detected RSI divergences. It uses a combination of entry signals, trailing stops, and adding new positions to optimize trading performance.

Key Features:
- Detects RSI divergences to identify potential trading opportunities
- Opens positions based on the detected divergences
- Implements trailing stop to protect profits and adjust stop loss
- Adds new positions based on new divergences to maximize profit potential

This EA is suitable for both beginner and experienced traders looking to automate their trading strategies based on RSI divergences. It offers flexibility and customization options to adjust the trading parameters according to individual preferences.
